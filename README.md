This is the final project I have created during the Digital Nation programm for IT & digital skills development. 
Starting from a smal demo website created by me (Chocolateria), I've implemented fundamental notions about:
- data structures, annotations and exception handling;
- how the Spring Network works and Spring Boot fundamentals: architecture, usage, configuration and libraries;
- REST, ORM, JDBC, JPA and microservices;
- Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, REST Controllers, Spring MVC and Thymeleaf with practical experience.
